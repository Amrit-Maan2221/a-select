# aSelect

The **aSelect** plugin transforms traditional HTML `<select>` elements into enhanced dropdown controls that display options in a tabular (grid) format.

This provides a more visually rich and powerful selection experience, especially useful when options have multiple data attributes that need to be displayed clearly.

## Why aSelect?

Built to solve real-world dropdown challenges that traditional select wrappers struggle with.

### Structured, Tabular Data

Most select wrappers support search, but very few support a true tabular layout. Real-world selections often require more context than a single label.

aSelect allows you to display multiple columns—such as Customer Name, Address, and Phone—inside the dropdown itself, without custom popovers or repeated UI logic as your application grows.

### Built for Massive Datasets

Dropdowns should not break when your data grows. Whether you have thousands or millions of records, aSelect handles it efficiently.

With server-side integration, pagination, and infinite scrolling, aSelect loads data on demand—keeping forms fast, responsive, and scalable.

### Cleaner, Smarter UI

Forms often need additional actions—like adding a new customer when the desired option doesn’t exist.

Instead of cluttering the form with extra buttons near labels, aSelect lets you place contextual actions directly inside the dropdown, near the search—keeping the UI clean and intuitive.
